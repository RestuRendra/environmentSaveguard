                    Through sustainable conservation efforts, we not only protect habitats for rare and endemic species, but also strengthen the protection of natural resources essential to human well-being. By understanding the ecological,
                    social and cultural value of Papua's forests, together we are building a greener and more sustainable future for all living things on this planet.

                  <h6>
                    Across the world, mountains that were once icons of natural beauty are now threatened by the accumulation of plastic waste littering their slopes. Aside from spoiling the stunning scenery, these build-ups also threaten
                    the natural ecosystems around them and pose health risks to the creatures that depend on them.

                    From small rivers to vast oceans, plastic pollution and other wastes continue to flow, polluting the environment and endangering aquatic life and the people who depend on it. Greater efforts are needed to tackle this
                    problem, including increased public awareness, strict policy implementation, and the innovation of environmentally friendly solutions to reduce and clean up litter littering waterways.
